                I am one of Jehovah's Wittnesses, so I preach door-to-door as well as write letters to people in my area about God's word.

                I love learning new languages, I am fluent in English, and Haitian Creole. I am semi-fluent in French. I am also learning Korean and Japanese.

                I also love travelling around the world! I have been to at least around 10 countries around the world so far!
